# Introduction

Hi, my name is Maciej. I'm an experienced software creator focused on iOS and Swift, interested in game development. Before iOS I used to make web apps in Python, Django, and CoffeeScript.

My current career goal is to work on user-facing applications at a product company, preferably remotely. I want to affect project decisions and be able to refine and polish the software I co-create.

I like Vim, Test-Driven Development, small commits, one letter shell aliases, and Oxford comma. I'm a heavy Git and GitHub user (I have almost 70 aliases and scripts in my [git config](https://github.com/narfdotpl/dotfiles/blob/master/home/.config/git/config)). Also, I used to have an Octocat on my car: <http://flic.kr/p/9ymNrs>. (I've since sold the car and bought a motorcycle. No eight-armed cephalopods on that one, yet.)


# Experience

I started making websites towards the end of primary school and I've been interested in web technologies since then. Over the years I've used different programming languages and technologies, like PHP, Python, Ruby, JavaScript, and CoffeeScript. In the last four years I became more and more interested in iOS, mainly because the User Experience is so good and the UI is much more responsive than on the web. I've been doing iOS development full-time for the last two years.


## Personal projects

I usually have a programming-related side project. I recently released a futuristic iPad game called [Glitchy Checkers](http://GlitchyCheckers.com), written in Swift and SpriteKit.


## Software Developer at Macoscope &middot; 2014–2015

For the last ~two years I worked at Macoscope, one of the best iOS shops in Poland. They make apps for clients, both startups and corporations. During my time there I worked on a dozen of projects, mostly iPhone and iPad apps (and one Mac app), none of which Iʼm allowed to talk about.

In addition to normal development work, i.e. analyzing requirements, creating architecture, and writing Objective-C code (which Iʼm not a fan of) and recently Swift (which I really like and promote), I helped shape the way we worked, gave internal talks, encouraged unit tests, and introduced a pull-request-based, always-code-reviewed workflow to the company.

I organized meetups and gave talks at a couple of [Swift Warsaw](https://github.com/SwiftWarsaw/SwiftWarsaw) events at our office, each hosting 30–70 people and ending in a party lasting to the late night/morning hours. Also at Macoscope, I wrote [SwiftyStateMachine](https://github.com/macoscope/SwiftyStateMachine), a Swift μframework for creating enum-based finite-state machines that can visualize themselves.


## Technical Advisor at 21 strun &middot; 2013–2014

When I decided to leave the company to focus on iOS and my own projects, I became the technical advisor to my former team. During my visits at the office I spent most of the time standing at the white board, discussing technical problems and new products, drawing UML diagrams, reviewing pull requests, eating pizza, and playing Urban Terror.


## Lead Programmer at 21 strun &middot; 2013

I led a team of a few programmers developing a web portal. I was involved in making product decisions, planning sprints, and interviewing new employees. Apart from writing a lot of code ;) I authored the architecture of applications making up the product and implemented many solu- tions regarding the development process, such as: code review through pull requests, automated tests, automated creation of development environments, automated deployment, etc.

Buzzwords: Python, Django, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Vagrant, Redis, etc.


## Software Developer at 300 D&C &middot; 2010–2012

I developed a Content Management System used by a couple of Polish news sites. I was the main technical person on the project. My responsibilities ranged from backend to frontend through deployment and contact with server providers.

As of autumn of 2012 one of the sites using the CMS I developed was handling about a dozen of millions of requests per day (and growing).

Buzzwords: Python, Django, JavaScript, CoffeeScript, jQuery, Backbone.js, Redis, etc.


## Software Developer at Sensi Soft &middot; 2010

At Sensi Soft I maintained and developed Django apps in a team of about a dozen people.

Buzzwords: Python, Django, JavaScript, jQuery, SQL.
