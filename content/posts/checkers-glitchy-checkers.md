Checkers, Glitchy Checkers
==========================

Why, hello!  First things first, the game has a name.  It's called
Glitchy Checkers and I'm about to release it! Woo-hoo!  I'd love it to
be on the App Store before Christmas.

TODO: hey narf, put a video here

I started making a website for the game at
[GlitchyCheckers.com](http://glitchycheckers.com/).  I also created a
Twitter profile at [@GlitchyCheckers](https://twitter.com/GlitchyCheckers)
and a [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/GlitchyCheckers), so you
can follow, retweet, share, and like everything. ;)  If you want to get
updates the old fashioned way, there's still the email
[newsletter](/newsletter) you can subscribe to.

I didn't write about Checkers on the blog in the last months.  A few
interesting things popped up during development that I hope to write up
after the launch.  I made some important changes in my personal life too:
a month ago I moved to a new apartment, left my job, and bought a 5k
iMac.  Yeah.  In the last two weeks of funemployment, I began getting
Glitchy Checkers ready for the release: adding sound, the "About" screen,
playing the game with friends, making last tweaks, creating the website,
etc.

Now that it's more "real", I'm getting excited! :)  I'll keep you posted
about the release.  Follow me on Twitter at [@narfdotpl](https://twitter.com/narfdotpl) not to miss it.
